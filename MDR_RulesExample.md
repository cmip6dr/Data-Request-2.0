The variable naming constraint can be expressed in the MDR: Naming Convention for the designation of a concept. The CMOR Variable Naming Convention can be described by the following 5 rules:

* scope_rule: The scope of the naming convention is all variables associated with the current CMIP ERA. It is prescriptive: variable names which do not
comply will be rejected.
* authority_rule: the naming convention is enforced by the WGMC Infrastructure Panel, normally delegated to the Data Request manager.
* semantic_rule: Names consist of a single word with no general separator. Elements of a name may be re-used to draw attention to related terms (e.g. 'ta' for air temperature and 'tas' for near surface air temperature). The name may have a mnemonic character, but there is no formal approach to deriving the definitions of terms from the names.
* syntactic_rule: the names should consist of a single word, with no delimiters.
* lexical_rule:  use only the characters a-z and numerals 0-9. Lower case is preferred, but upper case letters may be used to aid legibility. There is a uniqueness constraint: within the scope of this rule, names should be unique when used in combination with area type, frequency and vertical grid identifier. That is, if two concepts differ through properties which are independent of  area type, frequency and vertical grid identifier, then those two variables require distinct names.
